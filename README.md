# websitevoter
A python script with Tkinter GUI to vote for a website on multiple accounts including json database for account data.

I replaced the website I use this for by https://examplewebsite.com as it is probably not intended to use the site via script.

The app can read and update the json DB
It will interact with the site in order to vote for the website on multiple accounts.

It's my first time using python and tkinter.

Contact me if you are curious
Cheers
